# Code Refactor Starter Code

The original code for this project was pulled from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram

Per the brief, I was tasked with updating the code, and making it more accessible in the process. 

I did not consult other students within the bootcamp, nor did I speak with a tutor or staff on how best to conduct the project. My only help creating the repo was a reference to class zoom video. 

# The Brief #

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria #

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# Changes made #

In accordance with the brief, changes were made to the following aspects of the code:

** Added semantic html, substituting non-semantic html for semantic html throught the index.html document

** Updated CSS elements to reduce redundancy between the updated semantic html and the CSS stylesheets, removing unnecessary classes and replacing them references to the new semantic html sectoins. 

** Updated the title of the document to "Horiseon: Social Solution Services", which was originally listed as "title" to better align with brand recognition

** Added alt text for all of the images within the document

** Reordered the head order to put the stylesheets below the title of the document

** Notes are included within the HTML and the CSS indicating where some, but not all changes were made though most are implied within the notes.
